Jar of Flies is a beautiful and expressive EP by Alice in Chains, it was released in 1994. compared to the band’s usual heavy sound it has a more acoustic feel. This album brings sound that feels raw and personal. “Nutshell” “I Stay Away” and “No Excuses”are all somgs from this album that express an emotional sense of sadness and loneliness, but with those intense emotions these songs convery comes warmth and honesty. This is an EP that feels intimate, almost like it was written late at night when the world was still. Jar of Flies shows a softer and relatable side to the band.</p>

Black Gives Way to Blue feel heavy, but somehow full of light. It’s an album built on grief and survival, every note and lyric carries the weight of loss but also the willingness to keep going. This album feels mournful yet steady, sticking to their aesthetic.The silence between songs says as much as the lyrics do. There’s pain here, but also peace to be found.</p>

Dirt is suffocating and raw. This is the feeling of stepping into the darkest corners of the human mind. The album carries a heavy kind of pain and anger in the tone, as well as addiction and despair. But the honesty behind it comes off almost refreshing. This albu is beautifully messy, but so are humans and I think that's exactly what they we're trying to capture with this album. Listening to Dirt is like staring at your own shadows and finding uncomfortable comfort in them.</p>

The album carries that signature Alice in Chains heaviness, but with a sense of reflection. Looking back at where they’ve been and where they’re headed. It’s a record that balances anger and warmth, sorrow and strength, capturing a band that’s been through great storms but hasn’t lost its edge. Listening to it feels like being in a room with something powerful and slightly dangerous but you don't feel scared.</p>
<p><img src="/images/faceLift.jpg" alt="young boy standing behind a jar of flies with orange light shining through on a table.">
Facelift is a raw, aggressively exciting staple of early 90s grunge that hits hard and doesn’t let up. It’s got grit and anger, unpolished in all the right ways. The album brings tension and intensity, like walking on the edge of chaos. It feels alive and a little rebellious. The soundtrack of a band discovering their voice and unleashing it without holding back.</p>
